# Social Scheduler

This is a **Social Scheduler App** built using **React** and **TypeScript**. It shows a monthly or weekly calendar view and allows users to schedule social media posts with ability to upload an image, and generate a Pseudo-AI generated caption or use your own. Users can edit or delete these posts.

## Future Work

Future work might include:

- updating styling to be more modern instead of relying on Material UI styling.
- storing posts in database instead of locally within app
- ability to select which social platform to post to
- ability to save drafts
- error checking and form validation, length of caption, size of uploaded image etc.
- actually leveraging AI to generate a caption / image
- filtering functionality to filter by specific types of posts / social channels

## Disclosures

ChatGPT was leveraged to create a lot of the application code. My contribution as developer was to ask the right questions to generate the different components and add features, as well as checking the responses for code quality, validity and functionality.
